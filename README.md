# Simple blog using HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT and NODE.JS AS BACKEND.

I wrote this blog using node.js with backend with the aim of integrating it into my github portfolio, but unfortunately I didn't pay attention to the fact that github pages are for static pages, so it wouldn't be possible to use a server language.

I will leave the code in this repository, as it is a very simple and functional website and when I have time available, I intend to deploy this project on a platform that allows using node.js.
